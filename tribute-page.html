  <p>
    Abdellah Taïa is a groundbreaking novelist and filmmaker. Taïa was born to a poor family in Rabat, Morocco in 1973.  He suffered sexual, physical, and psychological violence as an effeminate gay youth.  Miraculously, Taïa overcame these many challenges to become one of the greats of 21st century francophone literature, a pioneering filmmaker, and a captivating orator.  Taïa's work is semi-autobiographical and looks unflinchingly at issues such as sexuality, poverty, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and cultural intersectionality.  As one of the first openly gay Moroccan, Muslim, and Arab public figures, Taïa has created an opening for a new generation of artists to explore what it means to traverse continents and identities.

      <p><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>  My family spent many years sleeping side by side in the same room. It's important for me to not separate myself from them or to say that I've suffered more than they have because I'm gay. We all suffered from the same political rejection, and from poverty. When you're starving with eleven other people in the same room, you become connected to them forever. We were all hungry at the same time.  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

      <p><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>  I started to write because of my dream to become a filmmaker. I got to know about a film school in Paris and it was my goal to get there. To do that I knew I had to learn French. In order to practice I started to write journals in French. The effort I made to master what I regarded a bad thing - a language owned by the rich Moroccans - brought me the ability to write.  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

You somehow have to kill yourself. This is asked of people who haven't got the tools to understand that it's all a social construction, and that they shouldn't inferiorize themselves. This is asked of little kids. But I still live in the same outcome.  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
